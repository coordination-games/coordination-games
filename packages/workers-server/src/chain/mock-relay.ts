/**
 * In-memory dev/test relay.
 *
 * MockRelay does NOT track credit balances. `getAgentByAddress` / `getBalance`
 * report `MOCK_CREDIT_BALANCE` (a very large raw-unit value) so the pre-game
 * balance check in `LobbyDO.handleJoin` passes for everyone in dev/test mode
 * — we'd otherwise need to run a local chain just to exercise the lobby path.
 * `topup` / `requestBurn` / `executeBurn` throw ("Credits not available in
 * mock mode"), and `submit` is a no-op that discards the deltas after
 * returning a fake tx hash. Because of that, the 6-decimal scaling applied
 * in `GameRoomDO.kickOffSettlement` (see `CREDIT_SCALE` in
 * `@coordination-games/engine`) has no observable effect here — scaled or
 * unscaled, the numbers go nowhere.
 *
 * Consequence: in-memory mode stays internally consistent whether deltas are
 * scaled or not, which is why the pre-scaling bug was silent. On-chain mode
 * is the only path where the scale mismatch would corrupt balances, and
 * that path is fixed at the settlement boundary.

 * gate. Expressed as a decimal string to match the on-chain `uint256` wire
 * format everywhere else in this file.
